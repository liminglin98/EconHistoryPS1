## I tried to write code to download the data directly from GitHub to avoid the issue with different file paths on different computers but was unsuccessful.
#url1 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liminglin98/EconHistoryPS1/main/stock_income.xlsx"
#download.file(url1, destfile = "stock_income.xlsx", mode = "wb")
#stock_income <- read_excel("stock_income.xlsx", sheet = 1)

stock_income <- read_excel("D:/My Drive/Sciences Po/Fall2025/Economic History/Assignment/Paul/stock_income.xlsx" , sheet = 1)
head(stock_income)
